The big idea is reddit plus git.

ANYONE can make a commit. the community then votes on whether the idea got
better or worse. The more popular leaves and branches are displayed higher up.
The most popular projects are recomended on the front page, and their genre 
page.

If many descendants of a common ancester get popular at the same time, the 
popularity of the most recent common ancestor goes up.

There should also be a discussion page. I want one for each commit, and one for the project as a whole. The one for the project as a whole could let people discuss the direction they wanted things to go in, branches, whatnot. The commit pages allow for easy feedback.
